# Diff between MySQL and noSQL DataBases

1) MySQL DB can only scale vertically and are also called relational Databases
2) noSQL DB can scale horizontally also very well
3) noSQL DB do away with the constly relationships, in noSQL every iteam in the database stands on it's own
4) **In Short noSQL are essentially key value stores**
5) Each itam in noSQL DB has 2 fields -> a unique key and value
6) Besides great scalability, noSQL is schemaless , which means that items in the database don't need to have same structure 
7) In relational DB you need to define your table structure, and then each item, must conform to it
8) eg- for noSQL in cloud are --->> Dynamo DB, BigTable and Cosmos DB
9) Self hosted noSQL are --> MongoDB, cassandra, scylla, CouchDB


# Whar are API's (Application Programmable Interface)

1) Uses of API's
   - access data from 3rd parties, eg- your phone uses API of 3rd party systems and fetch you the weather
   - hide complexicity and perform tasks, eg - app developers don't have to worry about setting up Wifi connection etc, instead this is done by API's
   - extend functionality 
   - Security , eg - when phone apps ask for your permissions these are the api's

# CIDR ranges 

1) CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16 = 65,536 IP addresses (/16 is CIDR range, the lower the number the more the IP address)
2)
