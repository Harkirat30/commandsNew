# Diff between MySQL and noSQL DataBases

1) MySQL DB can only scale vertically and are also called relational Databases
2) noSQL DB can scale horizontally also very well
3) noSQL DB do away with the constly relationships, in noSQL every iteam in the database stands on it's own
4) **In Short noSQL are essentially key value stores**
5) Each itam in noSQL DB has 2 fields -> a unique key and value
6) Besides great scalability, noSQL is schemaless , which means that items in the database don't need to have same structure 
7) In relational DB you need to define your table structure, and then each item, must conform to it
8) eg- for noSQL in cloud are --->> Dynamo DB, BigTable and Cosmos DB
9) Self hosted noSQL are --> MongoDB, cassandra, scylla, CouchDB
